### Hi there 👋
Welcome on my profile, just to talk about myself, I'm a self-taugh tinkerer playing with computer from toddlehood.

I made my first website in the 2000s just to learn how it was done and then I wanted my own server, ever since I felt in love with selfhosting. 
I learn't how to secure a web application from it's core software (generaly PHP) to the network layer.

I later worked in massmailling industry and had hardtime optimizing every little parts of my setup because infrastructures cost money, time and energy.

Nowaday I'm playing around with Home Assistant, trying to run everything I need on a minimalistics ARM server
